# ez

My personal collection of re-usable single-header libraries. They're mostly data collections or cross-platform wrappers. See the [table](#libraries) below for a basic overview of each library.

If you'd like to use any of these libraries, define ```EZ[NAME]_IMPLEMENTATION``` (or just ```EZ_IMPLEMENTATION```) in one of your source files. If you want to use custom malloc/free calls, define ```EZ_MALLOC``` or ```EZ_FREE``` before including. Realloc + calloc are also defined the same way.

## Libraries

| File               | Description                                                   | Additional info                |
| -----------------  | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **ezarena.h**      | Simple memory arena implementation using mmap+VirtualAlloc    | None                           |
| **ezclipboard.h**  | Get/set clipboard (text only) on Mac/Windows/Linux (GTK)      | `WIP: Emscripten support`      |
| **ezfs.h**         | Common cross-platform file system functions                   | None                           |
| **ezimage.h**      | Image manipulation, .png importing + exporting                | To disable text-rendering define `EZIMAGE_DISABLE_TEXT` and to disable saving/loading define `EZIMAGE_DISABLE_IO` |
| **ezmap.h**        | Simple key value map + dictionary                             | Some functionality relies on clang+gcc extensions, define `EZMAP_DISABLE_GENERICS` this removes the `ezMap` type |
| **eznet.h**        | Simple cross-platform TCP+UDP network library                 | `WIP: Not finished do not use` |
| **ezpoll.h**       | Very basic wrapper over epoll, kqueue and iocp                | `WIP: Not finished do not use` | 
| **ezrng.h**        | Simple pseudo random number generation                        | None                           |
| **ezstack.h**      | Simple double linked-list implementation                      | None                           |
| **ezthreads.h**    | pthreads wrapper for windows + thread pool implementation     | The pthread wrapper for windows is only a partial implementation, not all of the pthread API is covered. Define `EZTHREAD_USE_NATIVE_CALL_ONCE` and `EZTHREAD_USE_NATIVE_CV` to enable native `call_once` and conditional vars support on windows |
| **ezvector.h**     | Stretchy buffer implementation                                | Based off stretchy_buffer.h by Sean Barrett (nothings/sbt) |
